		<h1>Pacific Leaping Blenny</h1>
		<div>
  			<h2>A Fish That Crawls</h2>
  			<p>The Pacific Leaping Blenny <span class="highlight">Alticus arnoldorum</span> usually measures a few inches long, but it is a quite unique fish because of its extraordinary capacity to stay out of the water and actually crawl over wet surfaces. In spite of its need for moisture, the fish has essentially forsaken the sea and spends its entire life on land.</p>
   		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<p>The leaping blenny may make you think twice before saying you feel like a fish out of water.</p>
		</div> 
		<p class="ThirdPara">Is the leaping blenny the opposite of a whale?</p>
